\section{\texttt{one\_functor\textlangle TYPE\textrangle}}
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
struct greatest_functor;
\end{verbatim}
Provides a constant \texttt{operator()} which receives zero arguments and returns
the
greatest
value of type \texttt{TYPE}. The operator may be qualified as constexpr
and/or noexcept. Specializations for the types
\texttt{char},
\texttt{signed char},
\texttt{unsigned char},
\texttt{signed short int}       (aka \texttt{short int},     aka \texttt{signed short},     aka \texttt{short}),
\texttt{signed long int}        (aka \texttt{long int},      aka \texttt{signed long},      aka \texttt{long}),
\texttt{signed long long int}   (aka \texttt{long long int}, aka \texttt{signed long long}, aka \texttt{long long}),
\texttt{unsigned short int}     (aka \texttt{unsigned short}),
\texttt{unsigned long int}      (aka \texttt{unsigned long}), and
\texttt{unsigned long long int} (aka \texttt{unsigned long long}),
\texttt{float},
\texttt{double}, and
\texttt{long double}
are provided.

\section{\texttt{greatest\textlangle TYPE\textrangle()}}
Function returning the greatest value of type \texttt{T}.
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename TYPE>
constexpr auto greatest() noexcept(noexcept(greatest_functor<TYPE>()()))
  -> decltype(greatest_functor<TYPE>()())
{ return greatest_functor<TYPE>(); }
\end{verbatim}
The function is constexpr if `greatest_functor<TYPE>()()` is constexpr.
